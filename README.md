# iDragon-Adventure

I developed the iDragon Adventure Game with the help of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Story behind the game- When I was learning Web Development via Online class mode suddenly my Internet Connection got disconnected and this game appeared on the screen in which dinosaur jumps over cactus and protect himself from birds. I enjoyed playing the game and got a thought to build a game like this. So I started building this game but not exactly same I make some changes to make it my own game. 

How to play the game - There is a dinosaur living in hilly region and he has to save himself from Dragon who is coming towards him by jumping over it. When Dragon will approach dinosaur, then dinosaur has to save himself by pressing up arrow key in order to make a jump so that Dragon can pass without harming him. The number of times the dinosaur jumps and save himself, that many times the score board will increase. Once Dragon comes in the contact of dinosaur the game will be over there. It will display as Game Over - Reload to Play Again. 

I would like to share screenshots of my game so that you can have clear idea :) 

This is the screen of my Game - iDragon Adventure and it looks fascinating
